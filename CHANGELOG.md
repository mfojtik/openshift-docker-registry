## 0.7

Major architecture rehaul, with potentially breaking changes:

 * alternate storage drivers are now implemented as independent pip packages in their own github repositories
 * mainline docker-registry now only provide file and s3 storage

 * cookies are no longer used
 * CORS is now enabled on a number of endpoints

 * [BUGFIX] inconsistent cache-control headers
